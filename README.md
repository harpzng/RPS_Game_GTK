RPS Game in GTK

To get it working, you NEED to have gjs installed

*For Debian* sudo apt install gjs
*For Arch*  pacman -S gjs
*For Fedora/RHEL* idk, f# yourselves, idk if it's even packaged for u

After getting gjs installed, just navigate to the directory with the js main file (or whatever the main js file is called), and type\n
<code> gjs main.js </code>

Voila!
