## RPS Game in GTK

To get it working, you NEED to have gjs installed

*For Debian*: <code> sudo apt install gjs</code> <br> 
*For Arch*: <code> pacman -S gjs</code>  <br> 
*For Fedora/RHEL*: idk, f# yourselves, idk if it's even packaged for u (don't take it personally, i just hate fedora D:)

After getting gjs installed, just navigate to the directory with the js main file (or whatever the main js file is called), and type: <br>
<code> gjs main.js </code>

Voila!
